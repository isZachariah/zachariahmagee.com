# Creating this site 

I bought this domain zachariahmagee.com through [namecheap](namecheap.com) and got a droplet on [DigitalOcean](digitalocean.com) to host the site. 

This is the first full-stack site I have ever built all the way to production. I decided to build the front end with React and NextJS because I have
some previous experience with it and I think it will do just fine with the material I hope to post. The backend is nginx.

I was pretty excited to ssh into my first server. I created some public keys, got my IP address, and was off to the races.

I added various authorized_keys and set up my ssh config:

```c
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes

Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gh
```


### Bash Scripts and Cronjobs

using the command

```bash
    crontab -e
```

I implemented a cronjob to run a bash script every hour:

```
    0 * * * * sh /var/www/app/github.sh 2>&1 | logger -t github.sh

```
to pull the latest updates from my git repo, npm install any new libraries, build, and carry on serving:

```bash
#! /usr/bin/bash

cd /var/www/app
git pull origin master --ff-only
npm i
npm run build

```

### Logging

- syslog
- auth.log
- nginx/access.log

```bash
# output the beginning of the log
sudo head /var/log/syslog

# output one page at a time
sudo less /var/log/syslog

# output the entire log file
sudo cat /var/log/syslog

#follow the output of a file
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

-  |
	- read from stdout
-  {'>'}
	- write stdout to file
-  {'>>'}
	- append stdout to file
-  {'<'}
	- read from stdin
-  {'2>&1'}
	- redirect both stderr and stdout

### Nginx Server Block

The nginx server block I wrote to server this nextjs app looks like this:

```nginx
server {

        root /var/www/;
        index index.html;

        server_name www.zachariahmagee.com zachariahmagee.com;

        location /_next/static/ {
                alias /var/www/app/.next/static/;
                add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=3600, immutable";
        }

        location / {

                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }


    listen [::]:443 http2 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 http2 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/zachariahmagee.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/zachariahmagee.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}

```
